Routing Algorithms
================

These are Linkstate(Dijkstra) and Distance Vector(Bellman-Ford) implementation in C++.  
How to get:
-------------

    git clone https://github.com/rhuangab/routingAlgorithm.git
    Make
  
How to run:
----------
        
  * Run the Distance Vector Algorithm by file io:
  
        sh runDistvect.sh

    Or get input output from/onto console by adding the `-stdio` option, using std::cout and std::cin:

        sh runDistvect.sh -stdio

  * Run the Link State Algorithm:
  
        sh runLinkstate.sh

The output of these two algorithms are available in (by default setting): 
  
    outputLinkstate.txt
    distvec_output.txt
