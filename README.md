Routing Algorithms
================

These are Linkstate(Dijkstra) and Distance Vector(Bellman-Ford) implementation in C++.  
To compile:

    Make
  
To run:
  * run the Link State Algorithm:
  
        sh runLinkstate.sh
        
  * run the Distance Vector Algorithm
  
        sh runDistvect.sh
        
  * run both two and compare the two results. 
        
        sh runBoth.sh 

The output of these two algorithms are available in (by default setting): 
  
    outputLinkstate.txt
    outputDistvect.txt
